# RAKE_TextRank
An implementation of **Rapid Automatic Keyword Extraction (RAKE)** and **TextRank** algorithms for summarization of text.

## Usage
The *Resources* folder contains files *stopchars.txt* and *stopwords.txt*.
These files contain the stop phrases and stop characters which are used by the program to parse the input text into tokens.
They can be modified according to the specifics of the text.
The paths to these files are stored in constants in *main.cpp* however as an extension, the program could have been modified
to get the paths to these files from *environment variables*.
